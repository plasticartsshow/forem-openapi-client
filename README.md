## About working on `forem_openapi_client`
Hey! This library:

- Was *generated* using openapi_lib_generator v0.2.3 at 2023-04-10T05:06:38.929104+00:00.
- Implements the [forem](https://developers.forem.com/) API v1.
For these reasons, proposed changes to this repository will likely not be accepted. Try proposing changes to the generator tools instead.
- Uses the corresponding OpenAPI specification found at [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forem/forem/main/swagger/v1/api_v1.json].
